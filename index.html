                            Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers,
                            and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty
                            iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome:
                            4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits). Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994. How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?</p>
